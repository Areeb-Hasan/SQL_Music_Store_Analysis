# SQL_Music_Store_Analysis
The project is an SQL-based data analysis of a music store's database. The analysis is divided into three sections: Easy, Moderate, and Advanced, each addressing specific business questions. The database schema includes tables for artists, albums, tracks, employees, customers, invoices, and genres .

Easy Level
This section covers basic queries to find key information. It involves identifying the most senior employee by their job title , determining which countries have the most invoices , and finding the top three total invoice values. It also seeks to locate the city with the highest sum of invoice totals, which is considered the "best" city for customers, and to identify the single "best customer" who has spent the most money.

Moderate Level
The moderate questions require more complex table joins and subqueries. This includes querying for all rock music listeners, returning their email, first name, last name, and genre, ordered alphabetically by email. Another task is to find and list the top 10 artists who have created the most rock music, returning their name and total track count. The final moderate query is to find and order all tracks that are longer than the average song length.

Advanced Level
The advanced queries demand sophisticated SQL techniques like WITH clauses and window functions. The tasks include finding how much each customer has spent on specific artists , identifying the most popular music genre for each country , and determining the customer in each country who has spent the most money. For the last two questions, if there's a tie for the most popular genre or highest spending customer, all tied entries should be returned.

# SQL_Music_Store_Analysis
The project, titled "SQL_Music_Store_Analysis" focuses on analyzing a music store's database. The analysis involves answering a series of business questions using SQL queries. The queries are categorized into three difficulty levels: Easy, Moderate, and Advanced.

Project Scope
The project uses a database schema that includes tables for artists, albums, tracks, playlists, media types, genres, employees, customers, invoices, and invoice lines . The questions are designed to provide insights into sales, customer behavior, and music popularity.

Easy Level Questions
This section addresses fundamental questions about the music store's data. The queries are straightforward and focus on basic data retrieval and aggregation.
Senior Employee: Identify the most senior employee based on their job title.
Invoice Count: Determine which countries have the most invoices.
Top Invoices: Find the top three highest total invoice values.
Best Customers' City: Find the city with the highest total invoice sum to identify the best city for a promotional event.
Best Customer: Identify the customer who has spent the most money.

Moderate Level Questions
This section involves more complex queries that require joining multiple tables and using subqueries to filter data.
Rock Music Listeners: List the email, first name, last name, and genre of all rock music listeners, ordered alphabetically by email.
Top Rock Artists: Find the top 10 artists who have written the most rock music, returning their name and total track count.
Longest Tracks: Retrieve the names and lengths of all tracks that are longer than the average song length, ordered from longest to shortest.

Advanced Level Questions
The final section presents challenging queries that require more sophisticated SQL techniques, such as common table expressions (CTEs) and window functions, to solve.
Customer Spending on Artists: Calculate the total amount each customer has spent on a specific artist and return the customer's name, artist's name, and the total amount spent.
Most Popular Genre by Country: Determine the most popular music genre for each country based on the highest number of purchases. If there is a tie, all top genres should be returned.
Top Customer by Country: Identify the customer who has spent the most money on music in each country, along with the total amount they spent. If multiple customers have spent the same maximum amount, all should be listed.
